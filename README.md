# Lab11Gene

This respository is for the CPSC499 course on R programming, to practice putting S3 classes into an R package.

Fork this package, then edit R/classes_and_methods.R with your code from Lab 11.  Document your
functions and methods using .Rd files that you put into the "man" folder.  Lastly, edit the NAMESPACE file
to export your functions and methods.
