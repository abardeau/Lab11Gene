# Lab11Gene
This respository is for the CPSC499 course on R programming to practice putting S3 classes into an R package.

Fork this package, then make a folder called "R" in which you put your code from Lab 11.  Document your
functions and methods using .Rd files that you put into the "man" folder.  Lastly, make a NAMESPACE file
to export your functions and methods.
